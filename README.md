# Data_Science_for_Epidemiology
Respository for CSE 8803 @ GT

A respository folder for all homeworks and final project assignment practice for the Data Science for Epidemiology Course at Georgia Tech (CSE 8803)

Professor: Aditya Prakash

Course taken by: Shikhar Verma (Fall 2024)

All homeworks contain a file called "HW#_Document_Answers" which contain the homework's questions and answers. Each homework folder contains Q (question) folders that correspond to the coding questions asked in the homeworks.

The final project folder contains several GRU models I implemented (had to try different models because my PCC was not high enough). 
synaptic_GRU.py was the final iteration of the model I used to submit for the final project.
